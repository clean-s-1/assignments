# Assignments

The first assignment is simple - you need to perform basic statistics on a bunch of readings from a sensor.

The intention of this exercise is to check your participation. You would need some exploration to get used to GitHub, Actions and workflows.

Accept the assignment in a language of your choice. This will create a repository for you.
Look for `README.md` in your repository for further information.
